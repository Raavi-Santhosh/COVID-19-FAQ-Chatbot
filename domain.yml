  utter_about_corona:
  - text: A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
      The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses
      that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common
      cold. A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same
      as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared
      for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
  utter_corona_name:
  - text: On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official
      name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first
      identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease
      2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for
      ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as '2019
      novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV'. There are many types of human coronaviruses
      including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19
      is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously
      been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World
      Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming
      of new human infectious diseases.
  utter_source_corona:
  - text: COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are
      a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species
      of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  Rarely, animal coronaviruses
      can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV,
      and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to
      person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person
      coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people
      who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely
      when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). COVID-19
      seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”)
      in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected
      with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they
      became infected.
  utter_about_quarantine:
  - text: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed
      to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others
      who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease.
      Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable
      disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness
      after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last
      date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.
      Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk
      for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during
      the incubation period.
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general
      food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing,
      and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going
      to the bathroom. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching
      a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and
      then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not
      thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In general, because of poor survivability
      of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread
      from food products or packaging.
  utter_corona_warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu,
      spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible
      to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to
      learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with
      COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_community_spread:
  - text: Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area,
      including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
  utter_corona_surface:
  - text: 'Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures
      and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t
      have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based
      cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also
      be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. '
  utter_mosquito:
  - text: 'At this time, there is no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or
      other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way
      that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. '
  utter_corona_protect:
  - text: The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
      Clean your hands often with soap and water for at-least 20 seconds especially
      after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing,
      or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer
      that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub
      them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
      with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick Stay home
      as much as possible Put distance between yourself and other people. Cover your
      mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others Cover coughs and sneezes
  utter_symptoms:
  - text: Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and
      death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. These symptoms
      may appear 2-14 days after exposure (based on the incubation period of MERS-CoV
      viruses). * Fever * Cough * Shortness of breath Consult doctor immediately  if
      any of the symptoms shows up.
  utter_corona_airborne:
  - text: Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted
      through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. 
  utter_corona_transmission:
  - text: The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled
      by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with
      no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience
      only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease.
      It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example,
      just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research
      on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated
      findings.
  utter_worry_corona:
  - text: 'Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children
      and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5
      people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people
      to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
      We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones
      and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough
      hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow
      the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in
      place on travel, movement and gatherings.'
  utter_corona_risk:
  - text: While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons
      and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure,
      heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious
      illness more often than others.
  utter_antibiotics:
  - text: No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial
      infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics
      should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should
      only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. 
  utter_medicines:
  - text: While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and
      alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can
      prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any
      medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However,
      there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
      medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical
      findings are available.
  utter_corona_similarity_sars:
  - text: No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak
      of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other
      genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more
      deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks
      of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.
  utter_patient_zero:
  - text: The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in
      December 2019. At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely how
      humans in China were initially infected with coronavirus.
  utter_stage_of_corona:
  - text: "Stage 1 is the first appearance of the disease through people with a travel\
      \ history, with everyone contained, their sources traced, and no local spread\
      \ from those affected. The number of those infected would be quite low at this\
      \ stage.\nStage 2 is local transmission, when those who were infected and have\
      \ a travel history spread the virus to close friends or family. At this stage,\
      \ every person who came in contact with the infected can be traced and isolated.\n\
      Stage 3 is community transmission, when infections happen in public and a source\
      \ for the virus cannot be traced. At this stage, large geographical lockdowns\
      \ become important as random members of the community start developing the disease.\n\
      Stage 4 is when the disease actually becomes an epidemic in a country, such\
      \ as it was in China, with large numbers of infections and a growing number\
      \ of deaths with no end in sight. It is then considered to be endemic or now\
      \ prevalent in the region."
  utter_recovery_time:
  - text: Using available preliminary data, the median time from onset to clinical
      recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6 weeks for patients
      with severe or critical disease.
  utter_risk_people:
  - text: 'Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19
      are: * People aged 65 years and older * People who live in a nursing home or
      long-term care facility People of all ages with underlying medical conditions,
      particularly if not well controlled, including: * People with chronic lung disease
      or moderate to severe asthma * People who have serious heart conditions * People
      who are immunocompromised * Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised,
      including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune
      deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids
      and other immune weakening medications * People with severe obesity (body mass
      index [BMI] ≥40) * People with diabetes * People with chronic kidney disease
      undergoing dialysis * People with liver disease '
